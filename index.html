	<p>

	I am Chang Yeon Kim. I was born in Seoul, South Korea. 
	I am 25 years old, and this is because I served military for 2 years from 2012. 
	After discharge the service, my entire life plan has been changed. 
	I wanted to be a celebrity before so my previous major was theater as well.
	However, I changed my mind to not take a risk for getting a job. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The reason why I choose IS track as major is I thought learning about business is pretty necessary to get a job. 
	But at the same time, I have so much interested in computing since at the elementary school. 
	I started it from computer games, but now I want to know more about the computing skills rather than just playing. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	What makes me different is always finding adventures. 
	Not an adventure for finding treasure or gold, but I really like to start something unfamiliar. 
	I was the first graduate of my high school, and I volunteered it because I was curious about the new teachers and school.
	In addition, I had no friends or families who study abroad. I didnâ€™t want to be flowers in greenhouse. 
	Furthermore, there is not many colleges which have the major like mine, combination of business and computer science in my home country so I wanted to be a pioneer of this area.
